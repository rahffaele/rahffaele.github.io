  			<p>Through a project system based on the inspirational stories of various role models, we tried to reach the audience of young kids between the age of 11 and 14 to encourage them to pursue their passions and ambitions free from societal prejudices and stereotypes.</p>
  			<p>"Stemming" is "to S.T.E.M." in the progressive tense. "To stem" also means "to originate in or be caused by". The stem is the main body of a flower, that holds and feeds the branches of the plant.</p>

  			<h2>An intensive qualitative research at the beginning of the project highlighted – among other things – the efficacy of using role models as source of inspiration for young minds. Around this concept we built a three-parted design system.</h2>

  			<h3>Periodical issue</h3>
  			<p>The contact artifact is a periodical magazine. Each issue explores the story of a different role model, meaning an Italian woman known in the STEM area. As an example, the first issue is dedicated to Dr. Cecilia Laschi, a pioneer in the field of soft-robotics.</p>
  			<p>Every issue follows a same defined structure, even if the content changes. In the first part the reader is faced with a dfiferent aspect of the problematic of gender gap, in a way that is accessible to the young readers while still bringing awareness to the problem.</p>
  			<p>The second part explores the STEM field of that specific issue.</p>
  			<p>The last pages are entirely dedicated to the role model, telling her story with interviews, a biography and such.</p>

  			<h3>Social website</h3>
  			<p>In the final pages of the issue we placed a call to action: the reader is asked a direct question, which can be answered by quickly scanning the QR code alongside. The user can than post their thoughts on the wall of the site, reading and sharing thoughts with peers in a positive environment.</p>
			<p>The website also works as an archive of the past issues and hosts the manifesto of Stemming</p>
			<br>
			<h2>The aim of the site is to trigger a reciprocity mechanism in which every user becomes a role model for the others.</h2>
			<h3>Instagram</h3>
  			<p>The last part of the system consists in the official Instagram profile of the project.
			Through Instagram original content is shared with more frequency, while helping creating a sense of community and partecipation around the project.</p>
