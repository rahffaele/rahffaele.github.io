      <p>
        Friction is resistance. It derives from physical interaction between
        humans, and humans and things – its reach is holistic. All senses,
        elements and emotions play a role: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch,
        air, earth, temperature, agitation, passion, joy, sadness... With
        movement comes friction. The more we move and act, the more friction we
        encounter. The more friction there is, the more we engage and care.
        Friction drives our engagement. Friction, in this context, is not
        synonymous with either anger or conflict, nor is it malfunctioning
        technology. Friction is an essential ingredient that makes up our
        humanness and sparks human connection. Friction is a lively, intrinsic
        experience.
        <br />
        To facilitate it: design [products with] digital technology in a way
        that makes space for our humanness. Here friction is a core ingredient.
        Digital technology should create environments and situations in which we
        can truly connect with each other, as well as with the unknown, the
        uncontrolled, with all senses, all elements, all emotions. It should
        create situations that are not predicted, measured and calculated
        beforehand; situations that result from and amount to the present
        moment.
